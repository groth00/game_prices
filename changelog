## 2025-07-02

### Notes

### Added
- use tokio rt-multi-thread to download from stores in parallel
	- all stores with APIs/all stores which use browsers
	- might need to limit concurrency for browsers (currently launching 4)
- add command to importer load steam wishlist and print prices across stores
- download sitemap.xml for gamebillet
	- probably not useful since gathering 20 items per page may be faster than
	visiting 1 page at a time, even accounting for the small set of items that changed since the previous day

### Changed

### Removed
- removed intermediate subcommand from importer
